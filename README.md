A shitty piece of test code because I don't know anything.
This runs a simulation of a household using 20kWh per day of electricity.
This household is subject to random fluctuation up to the order of 0.1kWh per day.
A score is calculated based on reduction progress.
A rank is calculated based on which ladder the household falls under in terms of electricity.
This rank is /100.
This household will gradually reduce electricity consuption by 0.025 per day.
As a new ladder is reached, the code will shout HOORAY.

Enjoy.
